          <p>Hola Adit here!</p>
          <p>Software Engineer from Surabaya, Indonesia</p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m currently working full-time remotely at Sicepat Ekspres.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy learning and exploring new mobile and web technologies,
            staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends and news. Currently,
            I am focused on learning Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Honestly, I was inspired by Sutan Gading Nasution in creating this
            website. You might want to visit his site. I&apos;d also like to
            thank Zuhad Achmad Fachrian for helping me fill the content on my
            site.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my first personal website, which I have created and will
            continue to add new content and features to in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, if you want to learn more about me, you&apos;ve come to the
            right place.
          </p>
